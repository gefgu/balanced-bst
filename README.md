# Balanced Binary Search Trees

After learning about some algorithms and data structures, I decided to build a project to consolidate my learning. Using The Odin Project's tasks as guidelines and TDD, I implemented a binary search trees with several functions:

* Building of Tree given array
* Find: Given the value of a node, find the right node and return it.
* Level Order transversal
* In Order transversal
* Post Order transversal
* Height: Given a node, return its height. Height is defined as the number of edges in longest path from a given node to a leaf node.
* Depth: Given a node, return its depth. Depth is defined as the number of edges in path from a given node to the treeâ€™s root node.
* isBalanced: checks if the tree is balanced. A balanced tree is one where the difference between heights of left subtree and right subtree of every node is not more than 1.
* rebalance: Rebalances an unbalanced tree.

It also features an driver script to check most of these functions in action:

```bash 
node driverScript.js
```
